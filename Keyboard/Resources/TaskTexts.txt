the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
superman never wore a mask
a touchdown in the last minute
sign the withdrawal slip
the living is easy
two or three cups of coffee
soon we will return from the city
everyone wants to win the lottery
do you like to go camping
the children are playing
rapidly running short on words
we dine out on the weekends
put garbage in an abandoned mine
get aboard the ship is leaving
healthy food is good for you
if you come home late the doors are locked
the opposing team is over there
i want to hold your hand
good jobs for those with education
