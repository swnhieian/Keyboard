the quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog
pack my box with five dozen liquor jugs
he underwent triple bypass surgery
good at addition and subtraction
prepare for the exam in advance
go out for some pizza and beer
he cooled off after she left
salesmen must make their monthly quota
a thoroughly disgusting thing to say
pay off a mortgage for a house
sprawling subdivisions are bad
february has an extra day
questioning the wisdom of the courts
a yard is almost as a meter
an enlarged nose suggests you are a liar
physics and chemistry are hard
my favorite web browser
all good boys deserve fudge
safe to walk the streets in the evening
there are winners and losers
we went grocery shopping
hands on experience with a job
reading week is just about here
chemical spill took forever
traveling requires a lot of fuel
i just cannot figure this out
the stock exchange dipped
see you later alligator
the chamber makes important decisions
vanilla flavored ice cream
the most beautiful sunset
safe to walk the streets in the evening
your etiquette needs some work
handicapped persons need consideration
